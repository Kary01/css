            <p>Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter
            may have nestled its way into his mighty throat. Many a fat alley rat 
            had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of
            this awesome prowling machine. Truly a wonder of nature this urban 
            predator — Tommy the cat had many a story to tell. But it was a rare 
            occasion such as this that he did.</p>
